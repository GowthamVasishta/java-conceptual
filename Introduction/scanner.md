# Scanner class
Before we move onto loops, let us have a look at scanner as we will use it in subsequent programs.

 1. Scanner class is used to read values from keyboard during program execution.
 2. Scanner class is added in Java 5 version
 3. Scanner class is present in java.util package. So for importing this package : `import java.util.scanner;`.
 4. Creating scanner class object : `Scanner in = new Scanner(system.in);`.

### Methods of scanner class

 - `nextInt()` : used to read a int value
 - `nextFloat()` : used to read a float value
 - `nextDouble()` : used to read a double value
 - `next()` : used to read a string value

### Example code

```java
int n = in.nextInt();
double d = in.nextDouble();
String s  = in.next();
```
Now , I would like you to write a program using `scanner` class. In the next page we will move on to loops.
A simple program using scanner class. ( [scanner.java](https://github.com/GowthamVasishta/java-conceptual/blob/master/Introduction/scanner.java) )
